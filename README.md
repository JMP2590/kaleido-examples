# Kaleido Connection Examples

Welcome to Kaleido Connection Examples! The Kaleido team created this repository because
connecting to nodes in a Kaleido network is a bit different from connecting to nodes
in the public Ethereum network: Kaleido requires basic authentication credentials!

This project is organized into folders by language, framework, occasionally node type, and
communication protocol.

Each project executes a consistent scenario: fetching the latest block. This consistent
experience makes understanding each language and framework trivial when one understands
a single language/framework/protocol scenario.

# Contributing
Contributions are welcome and encouraged! If we do not already have an example for your framework or
language. Just make sure to follow the scheme described above!
